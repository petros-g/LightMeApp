## Overview

Welcome to the Light Me App workshop project! This project, developed in React Native, combines the power of IoT with the convenience of mobile applications. With the integration of an Arduino board, our app can send and receive information about the status of LED bulbs and room temperature in real-time.

### 🚀 Features:
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Keep track of your LED bulbs' status and room temperature from anywhere.
- **💡 Control LED Bulbs:** Turn your LED bulbs on or off remotely using the app.
- **🌡️ Temperature:** Receive status about the temperature.

### 🔥 Importance:
Integrating IoT capabilities into mobile applications opens up a world of possibilities for remote monitoring and control. The Light Me App demonstrates the practical application of IoT technology in enhancing everyday convenience and efficiency.

### 👥 Collaboration:
This project wouldn't have been possible without the collaborative efforts of our team. Each member contributed their expertise in React Native, IoT, and Arduino programming to bring this project to life. Together, we overcame challenges, exchanged ideas, and iteratively improved the app to ensure its success.


### 💡 Ideas (for expansion):
- **Temperature alerts:** Implement functionality to receive notifications when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.
- **Multi-room Control:** Implement functionality to control LED bulbs in different rooms separately.
- **Voice Control:** Integrate voice commands for hands-free operation of the app.
- **Customization Options:** Allow users to customize LED bulb colors and brightness levels.

Feel free to explore the codebase, or adapt it to suit your needs.
